                    <p>
                      To understand my review you must first understand what a
                      great game to me is.. A good game has emotion, story,
                      visuals sure.. But a great game gives you the ability to
                      experience all of those things for the first time in a new
                      setting with a fresh unexpected mindset ready to be blown
                      away. Experiencing feelings, euphorias, emotions
                      throughout the game that are so familiar but so different
                      at the same time. These games are rare! Going into
                      cyberpunk blind with no spoilers or really any idea of
                      what the game is, gave me the best introduction to the
                      game. Cyberpunk 2077 is truly a action, adventure, RPG.
                      Left me with a wow factor after 60hrs of gameplay time.
                      Still excited to get home from work and see the story
                      develop more. Graphics are amazing 9.5/10 Talents and
                      abilities are amazing 10/10 Story and character
                      development is perfect 10/10 Quests and gameplay are
                      immersive and keep you busy. 10/10 Side quest NPC
                      background is just as immersive as the main story. The
                      full control over players decisions play a great roll in
                      all of this. One of the best free-will gameplay scenarios
                      I’ve ever seen. You actually grow relationships (good or
                      bad) with these characters with an ever devolving
                      backstory to each one. You feel every emotion you should
                      to the characters. Every action you make plays a big roll
                      in the long run in the constantly evolving story more than
                      I’ve seen with any other game. Best way to describe the
                      choice options in cyberpunk is “it’s not so much black or
                      white choices, or A and B options all the time it goes
                      deeper than your average rpg”. This game goes on list with
                      the best games I’ve ever played. Along with. Farcry
                      Fallout Elder scrolls Mass effect Red dead GTA Games like
                      these only come around every so often so I suggest buying
                      it, playing it, and enjoying it. (Don’t worry about what
                      other people are saying when it comes to
                      bugs/glitches/etc. every giant open world game has these
                      and will be smoothed out over time. Take this game lightly
                      and you will enjoy every second of it.) Thank you Projekt
                      Red for a great game to finish off 2020 with!

                            <p>A welcome return to form for what was previously one of the greatest game franchises of all time. It could be on its way back to being an unforgettable series, certainly a great start. It seems 343 have listened to the fans, with this game best being described as a homage to the days of Halo 2 and 3. The open world experience of Campaign allows you to progress at your pace, exploring the world and side missions or simply powering through “main” missions. Multiplayer reminds me of Halo 3 with few maps but each of great quality. They are sandbox style maps, with fundamentally good gameplay. Prioritising a ‘cool head’ for steady aim is critical as headshots are essential to prevail in shootouts. To get the most out of this game, make sure you find controller sensitivity that suits you as halo’s ‘Spartans’ have a lot of armour, that is to say you’ll need to be able to keep your aim reticle on a moving target for longer than most shooters, with headshots dealing most damage. This took me a few days of finding what best suited my gameplay. I’ve played maybe a dozen hours multiplayer and the same for campaign and still have an appetite for both, progression is approx 50% for campaign and 30% for multiplayer battle pass. Updated multiplayer maps, game modes and campaign ‘events’ or new missions upon completion with an ever evolving story could make this game epic and give it some serious longevity. What we have here is a game with the potential to revive the Halo franchise, and one that is certain to win the 2021  “shooter war” between Halo, CoD and Battlefield. 9.5/10</p>

                                <p>This game is the best fifa instalment since fifa 17, people are complaining about things like ‘scripting’ but that’s because they don’t win every game, also it’s much harder to score this year with goalkeepers like this, but that’s the thing, it shouldn’t be easy, if it was so easy to score in real life there would be so much less emotion in the crowd when a goal is scored. Another good thing is that EA have made slower players with 70-75 much more ‘usable’ because of the way the game feels. A bad thing though, is that EA still has fifa points, so it can still be considered pay to win. But honestly, if you want to get as much enjoyment out of ultimate team, at least for me the best option is to go road to glory style. Career mode has been massively improved, with a complete refresh of player career and create a club being a returning game mode for the first time in YEARS. Normal manager career hasn’t been changed, but it’s still a very enjoyable gamemode, so no complaints from me. I haven’t tried pro clubs, seasons or Volta yet, but it looks like EA have made significant changes to all three game modes. </p>

                                    <p>probably the best NFS i have played. Graphics were amazing for even the older gen consoles like the ps3 and the xbox 360. i played this game on my ps3 and i loved every second of it. From the start to the end. The story line and the wonderfully made races. The "weapons" remind of the 2010(?) NFS Hot Pursuit and it's like a full upgrade from that. i loved this game and i honestly think that anyone that wants to get into the NFS series now, should start with this game. i rate it 9/10 (just because the AI cops were extremely annoying when you turned into a cop, they'd crash in front of you and block you in any way possible)</p>

                                        <p>I would recommend playing vanguard. I started my CoD plays with mw2019 and it was wonderful, loved animations, graphics, all the little details. Completed remaster of mw2 and didn’t like the engine/animations/movement at all, same with Cold War, too arcade, like I’m playing on an actual arcade machine lol. Vanguard brought back memories of first plays in mw2019, it is great, movement, gunplay, sounds, maps(design is better than mw2019, cuz I didn’t like them there), details, graphics. Perfect for run n gun type of gameplay, they tweaked hardcore blitz mode recently and omg, I love hc, it’s fun. It does have cons that need work, but nothing is perfect I guess. 
         Main pros: 
         - better map design than mw(not talking about Cold War maps, I find them too colorful and childish, plus there are tons of reboots of old maps)
         - great animations (more realistic than mw2019)
         - great level of details on each map, especially comparing to Cold War again, which are…ever played assault cube? That’s how I feel about Cold War lol.(it’s fun, especially with friends, but kind of … ehh)
         - character and map variety at launch(I really enjoy more or less milsimish outfits on characters without all that childishness of Cold War) 
         - gunplay (also will be in cons as got multiple issues) is just like a mw, feels like you are shooting a gun, sounds like you are shooting a gun, no nerf guns from cold war
         
         Cons: 
         -gunplay, kick from being hit by enemies needs adjustment and is incredibly high(not sure if it is made intentionally, feels like a bug, especially hard to play with snipers) 
         -multiplayer challenges doesn’t track right(but I believe we had that issue with Cold War n mw at launch as well)
         -gun leveling, there is 70lvls and they go incredibly slow which I also remember at launch of Cold War, I believe ppl complain about it and it gets fixed after a month or so, currently after 15 hours of multiplayer, almost maxed out one gun n one character lol(wasn’t concentrated on one either but still pretty slow) 
         
         
         Sum up:
         I like it, I would recommend it, you’ll especially like it if you can admire good map detailing and proper character animations, regardless if you get it or keep playing Cold War/modern warfare, make sure to have fun and bring some friends with you. I was open for Cold War after modern warfare even though I didn’t completely like it, it was fun, now it’s vanguard time
         
         Forgot to mention, playing on Xbox series S and it works like a charm, I am amazed on how good and smooth it looks</p>

What we have here is a game with the potential to revive the Halo franchise, and one that is certain to win the 2021  “shooter war” between Halo, CoD and Battlefield. 9.5/10</p>
