                                        <p>Do not buy this game ! .The gameplay is different for the better, but there is one thing that still remains is this game and that is scripting, you win a couple games and eventually you will go into a game where everything goes against you, your opponent wont even have to play defense and the cpu does it for him, yet you have to play perfectly to get the ball back, and most of the time you will have to tackle your opponent 6 times before you fet the ball back, cause he will get 5 bounces in a row going straight to his feet until he scores, ive played a lot of games like this, example, im up 2:1 in 90th minute, i have 15 shots to my opponents 2, my opponent is running with the ball, i tackle him, he gets the ball back, tackle again, straight to him again, i intercept but it bounces back to him, he shoots i manually block but still right back to him and then he takes a shot with Camavinga (65 shot) from 30 yards out, now you would think the goalie saves it since they are broken this Fifa, but no, the shot went in the middle of the goal through my goalkeeper, now you tell me if thats scripting or not. I have uninstalled this game after i played a fut champs match where i had 20 shots to my opponents 4, my players missed open goals, 4 yard headers, his goalie had 15 saves, 
          7 of those one on one, meanwhile my opponent got a penalty in the 90 th minute after he ran into an AI who i wasnt even controlling, the ai didnt even tackle him either, he just ran into him, and of course he scores for a 3:2 win, after the game i realised its better just to uninstall this than to keep sweating and getting mad over a stupid rigged video game, its just so laughable how scripted it is, and yes in every game there is a handicap to help out the worse player . More reasons why not to buy the game is that they change players stats in game. I have had Pele (94 pace) being outpaced by Coates and Maguire (64 pace and 50 Pace), i have had player like Jordi Alba apsolutely body Haaland and slam him to the ground. This game likes to help out the worse players cause they want to make an "Even playing field", but the real reason is because they just want to help out newer player or players who are bad at the game so they keep buying the game, everything in this game is to rip people off. Even the packs are a ripoff and conpletely rigged. Every year at the beginning of the year everyones pack luck is surprisingly good and you grt good players, but the more time goes buy the less your pack luck is. They give you good players at the beginning so you get hooked on packs so you keep spending money on fifa points thinking youre pack luck is good, its actually not, its just an EA tactic to scam you (as if 60 $ for the same game every year with a new cover star isnt enough of a scam). If people who dont believe me that scripting exists, i have won 5 games in a row multiple times, the 6th game my players feel so slow and stiff and my opponentsbplayers feel boosted, slow players are fast asf and my fast players feel slow as hell, then i literally just quit 5 games in a row right when the game started to test something out, and for the next 3 games everything went my way, i sidnt have to play defense, the cpu did it for me, my goalie made insane saves, my opponent dominated the game, had 20 shots to my 4 and i still won 3:2 and i know the game was scripted in my favour but i hate that, i dont want to play a game where these EA idiots decide who wins befofe the game even starts. Bottom line, this is the last year im buying this game, im tired of raging for no reason over a scripted and rigged video game.
         
         've also noticed that passing has a more realistic note to it. Rather than have every pass going to target there's more of a highlight towards the players attributes aswell, for example in fifa 21, you could pretty much long ball with any player with any long ball stat and hit your target 8 times out of 10 where as now the long ball attribute will play a big part in just how often and how accurate the pass will be. 
         
         Defending has definitely improved, tackles are more realistically executed and also players throwing themselves in front of shots is also alot more common which is something that was lacking in fifa 21. Impulsive interceptions are more common rather than letting the ball roll past a yard ahead of the player they actually actively try and sometimes succeed in intercepting. The create a club mode is a nice touch, reminds me of PES and its something that I've always wanted put into a fifa game and I've finally got my wish.
         
          In terms of online I don't really care for as my Internet isn't quite a strong enough to have a stable consist connection to allow for online gaming to be fun.
         
         So my review is purely based on gameplay in offline modes.
         
         As I said at the beginning this fifa is definitely alot better than fifa 21 and in my personal opinion the best the series has produced in atleast the last 3/4 if not 5 years. Naturally there's people that will disagree and each to the own.</p>

                                                                <p>This game is the best fifa instalment since fifa 17, people are complaining about things like ‘scripting’ but that’s because they don’t win every game, also it’s much harder to score this year with goalkeepers like this, but that’s the thing, it shouldn’t be easy, if it was so easy to score in real life there would be so much less emotion in the crowd when a goal is scored. Another good thing is that EA have made slower players with 70-75 much more ‘usable’ because of the way the game feels. A bad thing though, is that EA still has fifa points, so it can still be considered pay to win. But honestly, if you want to get as much enjoyment out of ultimate team, at least for me the best option is to go road to glory style. Career mode has been massively improved, with a complete refresh of player career and create a club being a returning game mode for the first time in YEARS. Normal manager career hasn’t been changed, but it’s still a very enjoyable gamemode, so no complaints from me. I haven’t tried pro clubs, seasons or Volta yet, but it looks like EA have made significant changes to all three game modes. 
                                 Thank you for reading my opinion on this really great game, and I hope that this can influence you.</p>
